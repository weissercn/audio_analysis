# audio_analysis
diving into audio data


Process with an LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03)

Analysis
- Anything odd?
- Visualize spectrogram



Do something
- split into sentences
- remove noise
- extend the audio
- 
- add watermark
- stich together
- compress
- distinguish speaker
- make one speaker say the content of the other. 

- speed up
- higher pitch

Extract useful info
- time


For the single speaker file:

Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Identify when the speaker is talking vs silent
Pitch tracking: Extract fundamental frequency (F0) to analyze intonation
Speech rate: Count syllables/words per minute
Formant analysis: Extract vowel characteristics

For the audioguide:

Segmentation: Automatically detect speech vs music segments
Speaker diarization: Verify it's the same speaker throughout
Music detection: Use spectral features to identify music sections

4. Advanced Features
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
pythonmfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y1, sr=sr1, n_mfcc=13)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
librosa.display.specshow(mfccs, x_axis='time')
Zero-crossing rate & Energy
pythonzcr = librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y1)
rms = librosa.feature.rms(y=y1)
Spectral features

Spectral centroid (brightness)
Spectral rolloff
Spectral flux (change detection)

5. Interesting Explorations
A. Emotion/Sentiment Analysis

Extract prosodic features (pitch variance, energy patterns)
Analyze speaking rate changes
Look for stress patterns

B. Audio Fingerprinting

Create unique signatures for segments
Useful for identifying repeated phrases or patterns

C. Speech Enhancement

Noise reduction using spectral subtraction
Dynamic range compression

D. Music/Speech Classifier
pythondef is_music_segment(y, sr, window_size=2.0):
    # Extract features for classification
    spectral_contrast = librosa.feature.spectral_contrast(y=y, sr=sr)
    spectral_flatness = librosa.feature.spectral_flatness(y=y)
    
    # Simple heuristic: music has higher contrast, lower flatness
    return np.mean(spectral_contrast) > threshold
6. Interactive Demonstration
For the presentation, I'd create an interactive Jupyter notebook with:

Real-time visualization:

Waveform with playback position
Live spectrogram updates


Feature extraction dashboard:

Pitch contour overlay
Energy envelope
Speaking rate graph


Segmentation demo:

Automatic speech/music boundary detection
Visual markers for transitions


Audio manipulation:

Time stretching without pitch change
Pitch shifting
Noise reduction demo



7. Practical Applications
I'd showcase how these techniques apply to:

Voice assistants (VAD, speech recognition preprocessing)
Podcast editing (auto-segmentation, silence removal)
Language learning (pronunciation analysis)
Audio accessibility (speech-to-text preparation)
